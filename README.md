- 👋 Hi, I’m Pablo Muñoz-Rodríguez, a researcher at the University of Oxford.
- 👀 I’m interested in botany, mainly plant taxonomy, systematics, phylogenetics, and conservation.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on the taxonomy and systematics of several poorly known tropical groups of plants.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that involves taxonomy and systematics, really.
- 📫 You can find more about me at www.pablomurod.com.
